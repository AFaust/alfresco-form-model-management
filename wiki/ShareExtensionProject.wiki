*Please ensure you update the FM Module to version 1.2.9 as this has a new menu item; Advanced search setup.*

= Share Extension Project =

This project will consist of a number of Share enhancements. To start off i have moved the FM Demo dashlet, form extension pieces and the advanced search all into one AMP. There also checked into SVN.

I have uploaded a share amp fm-share_1_2_0.amp to the download sectoin. This amp contains files that will REPLACE the alfresco search with one that uses the Form Management forms.

[http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-form-model-management/downloads/detail?name=fm-share_1_2_0.amp&can=2&q=#makechanges Here is the AMP]

== Installation ==
Please diable SOLR 

 #  Locate \tomcat\shared\classes\alfresco-global.properties
 #  Comment out solr and change the index subsystem to lucene like below
{{{
### Solr indexing ###
##index.subsystem.name=solr
#dir.keystore=${dir.root}/keystore
#solr.port.ssl=8443

index.subsystem.name=lucene
index.recovery.mode=FULL
}}}

Install the AMP

== Search Setup ==

Click the search menu item in the FM Console. It allows your to create a profile of aspects for your search.

== Nice to know ==

# No server restarts for advanced search changes
# If there are any fields you want to hide there is a toggle in the form builder to hide FIELDS in search.
